Controls:
WASD - move around world
M - Toggle material
N - Toggle normal coloring
IJKL - Rotate specific models (mostly the rabbits/patricks)
Z - Toggle shading method
Q - Move light source in POSITIVE x
E - Move light source in NEGATIVE x

The only part that I'm iffy about is my lighting.  I left in the controls to move the light source (which is the yellow cube) around so it can be observed.

This program has it all!  A plane! At least 10 copies of 2 models (one obj and one hierarchical)!  Things within the scene moving!  The ability to move around the world!  Scrolling the mouse to change what the camera sees!  Lighting!

There is also an image, as requested, of what my light should look like in the world.  I'm using a light source at the center of my world that radiates out.  The light source can be moved, as mentioned above.

This should also use up my final late days.  Just wanted to mention it...
